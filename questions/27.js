// What are anonymous functions and lambda functions in JS

// If there is a name after function, it's a named function; otherwise, it's anonymous.
// - can be passed as an argument to another function;
// - can be stored in a variable;
// - can be called in place
// - Arrow functions in JS are always anonymous.
// A good article on the topic https://medium.com/devschacht/anonymous-functions-in-javascript-ff6b9ba85de0

// Lambda functions:
// - are unnamed;
// - can take only one argument;
// - is used for binding variables;
// - can be passed as an argument to another function or returned from a function as a result;
// - cannot affect the external code (without side effects).

// What is the difference between Object.freeze and Object.seal methods?

// Object.freeze(obj)
// It prevents adding, deleting, and modifying properties; all existing properties are made configurable: false and writable: false.


// Object.seal(obj)
// It prevents adding and deleting properties; all existing properties are made configurable: false.
